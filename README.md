09/18/2021 Finally got my local Git Bash linked to my Git Hub account on line. There were 2 issues...
1. My Xcode GitBash was in need of update but would not update without updating my OS first. I do not want to update my os because I would loose use of some of my older programs. I was able to update with homebrew. Issue fix was to correct the mapping of Git Bash. Turns out that it was launching from an old Xcode location. 
2. Even after updating GitBash I still was unable to run some functions like launching VS code from Terminal/Bash. When I installed VS Code, I mistakenly installed it to my Desktop instead of installing it to Applications. After moving app, everything worked.
